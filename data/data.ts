      content: "These homemade cupcakes are similar to my famous easy chocolate cake recipe and easy buttercream frosting, but even easier to make! Even my daughter, Avalon could make these cupcakes at 5 years old. The trick is warming your wet ingredients and not over-mixing the batter so that it stays cohesive and doesn't separate. Many meringue-based frostings use eggs as a key ingredient. This chocolate buttercream is a mock-Swiss meringue buttercream where you skip the step of heating the eggs with sugar. Pasteurized egg whites are heat treated and are safe to eat without cooking and normally come in a carton.",

Next.js uses React to deploy apps. || When to use React vs. Next.js > Use React for building apps like social media apps or streaming tools. Use Next.js for building apps like e-commerce, marketing websites, or simple landing pages. Next.js benefits Improves performance and SEO, Streamlines the development process, Provides a built-in file-based routing system, and Supports configurations with touch tsconfig.json. React is less SEO-friendly because search engines may struggle to index content that requires JavaScript execution to render. On the other hand, Next. js is more SEO-friendly than React because it renders content on the server, providing fully-rendered HTML to search engines for easier indexing",
